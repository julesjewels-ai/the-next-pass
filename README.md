# Career platform for the 98% of college athletes who don't go pro

Four years of 5am workouts. Film sessions. Travel. Missing classes for games. Then graduation hits and suddenly the structure disappears. No more coaches. No more teammates counting on you. Just a degree in communications and a LinkedIn profile that says student-athlete like that means something to a hiring manager. 500,000 NCAA athletes graduate every year. Less than 2% go pro. The other 98% need jobs. They've spent four years building skills no resume captures - discipline, teamwork, performing under pressure, coachability - while their non-athlete classmates were doing internships and building networks. The skills are there. The language to describe them isn't. Next Chapter does the translation. Team captain becomes led 85-person organization through high-stakes performance cycles. Film review becomes analyzed performance data to iterate on strategy. The platform matches athletes with employers who already want them - Enterprise, Northwestern Mutual, Oracle actively recruit former athletes. They just can't find them efficiently. Athletes use it free. Employers pay K-25K annually for access to the talent pool. Athletic departments pay K-50K for white-label versions they brand as their own career service - a recruiting tool for prospects and a support system for alumni. Start with five athletic departments. Build the translation engine and employer matching. Let the success stories do the marketing - the athlete who landed at Goldman tells her teammates, the one at a startup posts on LinkedIn, the coach starts mentioning it to recruits. The flywheel is built into the community. Even 10% adoption is 50,000 athletes annually flowing through the platform. The talent is elite. The employers are hungry. The introduction was missing. Not anymore.
